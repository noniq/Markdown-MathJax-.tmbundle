# Markdown-MathJax.tmbundle

Install this bundle if you want the Markdown preview command to support MathJax.

This functionality has been extracted from the Markdown bundle (FIXME: Add link to corresponding commit). Previously it was necessary to set `TM_MARKDOWN_MATHJAX` to enable MathJax support. **This is no longer necessary.**
